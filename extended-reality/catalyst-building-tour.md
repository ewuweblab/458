## The New Dept. of Design

We are our own Department. For decades, Visual Communication Design (VCD) was a _program_ along side : Mechanical, Electrical, and Applied Technology. All of these majors have changed with the times. Now, VCD is the Department of Design with fields of study for current and emerging fields.

## The BDes

The creation of the BDes degree was a major achievement. BDes degrees are offered by many esteemed universities and is better suited to what-we-do. Salaries are typically higher for Bdes degree, can lead to Masters of Design, and transitions into the overall aping fields of UX Design.

## Catalyst Building

Why did we move from the Cheney Campus? Many reasons. A few are: we needed more space, closer to Industry down town, fields overlap with Computer Science and Electrical Engineering (who also moved) and collaborate inside and outside of Eastern.
