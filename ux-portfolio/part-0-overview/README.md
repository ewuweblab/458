> A _UX Portfolio_ is NOT a _Graphic Design portfolio._ Process and the Product.

### Overview

A User Experience (UX) Portfolio is different than traditional visual design portfolio in a number of ways:

1. **Biography**: A biography of the UX Designer’s experience, principles, skillsets, aspirations, and fields of interests.
2. **Metadata**: Relevant information about the Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How?
3. **Content**: Words, images, (and movies) to explain _deliverables_ produced.
4. **Design & Production**: Visual Design, Art Direction, Branding. Formats such as detailed PDFs, interactive sites, or video explanations, et al.
5. **Delivery**: Who will view your Portfolio? How will you promote it?
