# Part 5 : Delivery

> You and Your work. Will not sell itself.

### Overview

Too many services and mediums to list. Find one you like, but remember, always own your own content.

* How will the _UX Portfolio_ be delivered?
* Again, own-your-content
* Control the presentation of yourself and your work
* Be cautious of relying on a single platform or format
* Your work and your name will not sell itself ( later in your career it may )

### Delivery Methods

Many methods of delivery are possible â€” and problematic. Consider all the PROs and CONs of each method of delivery. No one method is perfect.

**ONLY PDF** is required for grading. Highly recommended additional-methods to deliver your Portfolio.

Note, this PDF is required for grading.

### Figma Link

  * Note: Not all people - e.g. Hiring Managers, Recruiters, etc - understand how to navigate between _Figma Pages._

#### Your Website

### Make a Connection (Optional)

Optional, but HIGHLY recommended. Before applying to job, make a connection at that Company.

1. Make a Connection. Find a local, regional, or national Group or Company. Connect with someone in that group. Answer:
   * Who are they?
   * What do they do?
   * Who do they work for?
   * Will they look at your Portfolio?
2. How would you describe your Brand?
3. UX is broad, what areas would you like to work in specifically?
4. What part of the Country (or World) do you want to work in?
5. What is an ideal annual salary?
