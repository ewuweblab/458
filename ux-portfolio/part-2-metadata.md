# Part 2 : Metadata

> Information, about the information.

### Overview

Relevant information about the Who, What, Where, When, Why, and How?

### Projects

From Fast Company, [_The Intricate Anatomy of User Experience_](https://www.fastcompany.com/1671735/infographic-the-intricate-anatomy-of-ux-design) shows how broadly UX projects can be defined. Ask yourself:

* What projects from other classes and/or outside-of-school, improved an experience?

For example:

* A package design project that is easy-to-open and is recyclable
* An environmental design project in public/private spaces
* An art project that viewers interact with
* A motion design project to simplify and communicate complicated ideas
* Illustrated icons used to communicate navigation through content
