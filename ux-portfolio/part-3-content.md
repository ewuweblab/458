### Words

Sell your work. Explain what your role. Analyze the results. Have it reviewed/edited by another person or the [EWU Writing Center](https://access.ewu.edu/writers-center).

Good example of clear writing for [UX projects by Kristian Tumangan](http://kristian-tumangan.squarespace.com/array).

### Writing Tips

### Deliverables

_Deliverables_ are artifacts of a Project. _Interviews, Personas, Experience Maps, Card Sorts, etc._ not the Project itself, but the **artifacts** of the processes. Properly explain the _deliverables_ and why it’s included in your Portfolio.

Examples of clearly presented deliverables:

### Images

Context is key for images. Not everyone will understand it. Even if they do, eliminate guesswork. Avoid overly generic imagery — see [This Is A Generic Brand Video.](https://dissolve.com/showreels/this-is-a-generic-brand-video)

* Add titles, descriptions, annotations, notes, etc.
* Select meaningful images.
  * Bad: [Laptop and Coffee](https://www.google.com/search?q=laptop+and+coffee\&tbm=isch\&tbo=u\&source=univ\&sa=X\&ved=0ahUKEwiRrKOWnYnUAhWLH5QKHbZ5A\_QQsAQIKg\&biw=853\&bih=892), [Website Mockup](https://images.template.net/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/11121525/Unique-Responsive-Website-Mockup-Template.jpg), [”Attractive people with thick glasses”](https://www.google.com/search?q=attractive+people+with+thick+rimmed+glasses\&tbm=isch\&ved=2ahUKEwiDgYLQmqXpAhUdJDQIHdnoADkQ2-cCegQIABAA\&oq=attr\&gs\_lcp=CgNpbWcQARgAMgQIIxAnMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgQIABBDMgIIADICCAAyAggAMgIIADICCAAyAggAOgcIIxDqAhAnOgUIABCDAVDsiQFYsZsBYNmqAWgCcAB4AIABVYgB2AOSAQE2mAEAoAEBqgELZ3dzLXdpei1pbWewAQo\&sclient=img\&ei=v861XsOlOp3I0PEP2dGDyAM\&bih=892\&biw=853)
  * Good: The best images are you own

### Objectives

Keep these objectives in mind for your Portfolio content.

* Reduce uncertainty about what the viewer is reading and seeing
* Quantify your work whenever possible with analytics, metrics, and measurable successes
* Summarize:
  * What did you learn?
  * Insights that surprised you?
  * Challenges and solutions
  * Avoid, “I didn’t do this”. Focus on what you did.
  * Testimonials

### Create Content

* [ ] Collect assets for each deliverable to showcase e.g. screenshots, links to files, images of use, etc.
* [ ] Write explicitly defined _Deliverables_ for each project e.g. _Interview, Persona, Experience Map, Card Sort, etc._
* [ ] Save this content to any format, tool, or service you like
